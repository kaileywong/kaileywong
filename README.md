# Hi! I'm Kailey Wong 👩🏻‍💻

I'm an undergraduate student at UC San Diego studying Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics who's passionate about software development. I enjoy web development across both the front-end and back-end, figuring out how to automate processes, and creating aesthetic and user-friendly web designs.
